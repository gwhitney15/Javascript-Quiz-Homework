This is a javascript quiz.

When the start button is clicked then the quiz begins and the user is presented with options to select. When the correct answer is selected it moves on to the next question.

When the incorrect option is selected, 10 seconds is removed from the countdown.

I had trouble figuring out how to store high scores in local storage. I would improve this in the future to be able to list high scores properly.
